This project was intended to familiarize myself with the
basics of html and CSS styling.

In it, I recreated a rough approximation of the Google homepage.
The difficult part was recalling the techniques used for positioning
elements and keeping them organized with each other. I feel as
though I did an okay job of keeping the code itself fairly
organized and readable, but I'm certain that there are much
cleaner and more efficient ways of doing this project. I am 
happy with how it turned out though, since this was my first 
time using html and css outside of very guided tutorials.
